When you perform a squat, you’re using your hamstrings and quadriceps to bend your knees and move your legs in front of you. For the deadlift and barbell row, you may want to add some weight to the bar so it can lift the bar off the floor. An advanced trainee can do them with their feet elevated, using an exercise band for additional resistance. Beginners shouldn’t push themselves too hard, and should rest between sets to stretch and recover.
