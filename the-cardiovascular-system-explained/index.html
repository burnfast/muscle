The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. This amazing muscle produces electrical impulses through a process called cardiac conduction.these impulses cause the heart to. If the health of the cr system were compromised enough, survival would be impossible. This chapter is dedicated to the heart and its many parts.
