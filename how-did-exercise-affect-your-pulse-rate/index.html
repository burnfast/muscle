<h3 id="a-swelling-in-the-carotid">A Swelling In The Carotid.</h3><p>The human body must pump blood throughout itself to provide oxygen and nutrients for the brain and other components for the human body to function properly. Whilst doing exercise there is an increase in respiration, this means that the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood will also increase as the oxygen is used up. The most efficient way to meet these needs involved the use of oxygen to break down glucose. Table 2 showing radial pulse rates before, during and after exercise.</p>

If you become too hot or too cold your body senses a thermal stress load.</p>
<h3 id="this-range-is-your-target-heart-rate-zone">This Range Is Your Target Heart Rate Zone.</h3><p>The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output. During normal respiration the heart rate tends to slow faintly during inspiration (as you take breath in). Now, compare your heart rate during exercise to your maximal heart rate.
