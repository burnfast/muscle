Be careful when you only read. Although there was only a significant difference in lower body maximal strength between groups, accommodation resistance training may induce a physiological training response by improving the strength and power of stabilizing muscle groups required to balance the bar if consistently used over time. The benefits of improving explosive power are vast and apply to a variety of populations. Be careful when you only read.
