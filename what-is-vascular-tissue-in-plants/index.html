The tissue includes several types of cells, such as sieve elements, parenchyma, sclerenchyma, and companion cells. Vascular plants contain vascular tissue composed of tubelike cells that transport food and water throughout the plant. The plant vasculature is a sophisticated system that has greatly contributed to the evolution of land plants over the past few hundred million years. One defining characteristic of the vascular plant is root, stem, and leaves.

<p>The below mentioned article provides an overview on the vascular tissue system of plants. Vascular tissues are complex conducting tissues in higher plants that are made up of different types of cells and elements. They typically occur together in vascular bundles in all plant organs, traversing roots, stems, and leaves. The vascular tissue system consists of the complex tissues, xylem and phloem, which constitute discrete conducting strands called vascular bundles.

Xylem is responsible for the transport of water and dissolved ions from the roots upwards through the plant. Xylem is present throughout multiple parts of the plant.

<p>How are vascular tissues arranged in dicot stems? A plantâs vascular tissues transport nutrients throughout the plant, just as the circulatory system transports nutrients throughout human bodies. Phloem is the vascular system that carries food and water to parts of the plant. They differ from nonvascular plants, which do not have conducting tissues, and require water for fertilization.

<p>The xylem is a tissue that supplies water throughout the parts of the plant. The xylem tissue in vascular plants is rigid and can be fossilized. The two kinds of vascular tissue: Vascular plants are those plants, which have specialised vascular tissues for the transport of water, minerals and food.

<p>What are the vascular tissues in plants? The plant vasculature is a sophisticated system that has greatly contributed to the evolution of land plants over the past few hundred million years. Vascular plants have vascular tissue that has helped them thrive as terrestrial organisms. The xylem is a tissue that supplies water throughout the parts of the plant.

<p>The vascular tissue system consists of the complex tissues, xylem and phloem, which constitute discrete conducting strands called vascular bundles. The plant vascular system is a complicated network of conducting tissues that interconnects all organs and transports water, minerals, nutrients, organic compounds, and various signaling molecules throughout the plant body.
