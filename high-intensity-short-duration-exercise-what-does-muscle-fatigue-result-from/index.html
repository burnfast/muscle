The limitations of a nerve’s ability to generate a sustained signal (neural fatigue); Muscle fatigue is defined as the inability to maintain a desired power output—resulting from muscle contraction against a load—with a decline in both force and velocity of shortening. Muscle fatigue is the decline in ability of muscles to generate force.it can be a result of vigorous exercise but abnormal fatigue may be caused by barriers to or interference with the different stages of muscle contraction.there are two main causes of muscle fatigue: When a person takes part in exercise the cardiovascular, respiratory, energy.
