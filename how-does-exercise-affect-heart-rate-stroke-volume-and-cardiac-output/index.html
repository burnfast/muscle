<p>The effect of exercise on cardiac output, with the consistent conclusion that exercise can significantly affect cardiac output, particularly during high intensity exercise bouts. So cardiac output is quite simply the product of heart rate and stroke volume. Therefore, cardiac output rises during exercise due to increased stroke volume and heart rate. There is a major difference in cardiac output between trained and untrained individuals performing endurance activities.</p>

<p>The cardiac output = heart rate x stroke volume. Generally, the resting cardiac output is about 5 liters per. During exercise, the cardiac output increases more than the total resistance decreases, so the mean arterial pressure usually increases by a small amount.

Pulse pressure, in contrast, markedly increases because of an increase in both stroke volume and the speed at which the stroke volume is ejected.in addition, working muscles increase stroke.

<p>Stroke volume refers to the amount of blood that is ejected by the heart with each beat.; The heart rate has a direct effect on the cardiac output, if increases, the. Therefore, cardiac output rises during exercise due to increased stroke volume and heart rate. Cardiac output can be calculated by multiplying stroke volume, or the amount of blood your heart pumps with each beat, times the number of times it beats per minute, or your heart rate.

<p>Therefore, cardiac output rises during exercise due to increased stroke volume and heart rate. When stroke volume decreases the body attempts to maintain adequate cardiac output by increasing the rate and strength of cardiac contraction. Cardiac output (co) is the blood volume the heart pumps through the systemic circulation over a period measured in liters per minute.[1][2] there are various parameters utilized to assess cardiac output comprehensively, but one of the more.

Pulse pressure, in contrast, markedly increases because of an increase in both stroke volume and the speed at which the stroke volume is ejected.in addition, working muscles increase stroke. A stroke volume of 100/minute and a heart rate of 50/minute would yield an acceptable cardiac output of 5 litres. Stroke Volume and Cardiac Output.</p>
