The effects of aerobic and anaerobic exercise on a human’s pulse, respiration, body temperature, and blood pressure abstract: Significant amounts of oxygen are consumed by the human muscles when. Weight training will have the greatest effect on your metabolic rate. Aerobic activities can be sustained for long periods of time depending on your exercise intensity.

<p>Energy comes from food which is converted into glucose and for the most efficient energy supply muscles also need oxygen. To test how much aerobic exercise raises the heat beat of a people, a person will take there resting heart rate, this is the heart rate of a person before doing any form of strenuous activity, for 1 minute using a stop watch, to make sure it is accurate. And determine how the ability of anaerobic fitness influences aerobic exercise. Glucose + oxygen = carbon dioxide. Exercise Overviews Understanding Your Options by Keenan Eriksson.</p>

While anaerobic exercise uses energy from muscles, aerobic exercise uses the energy stored in your body from carbs, proteins, and fats in combination with the oxygen we breathe to make energy readily available to the muscles. The exercise essentially maintains fitness and improve health hence it is necessary for physical rehabilitation of the body. It reduces the risk of many diseases including.</p>

Anaerobic and aerobic exercise were determined to effectively influence muscle oxygen uptake at the cellular level. Anaerobic exercise is used and circles in on size of muscle, endurance.

When energy is produced using oxygen this is called aerobic respiration. It is performed for variety of reasons which include weight loss, fitness, strengthening muscles and enhancing immune system. Evaluating and measuring the effectiveness of the two types of exercise on oxygen uptake would inform the advantages and disadvantages they have on muscles.</p>

The working ability of a muscle depends on sufficient blood flow, oxygen, and nutrition intake. Here are basic factors on how aerobic and anaerobic exercise influence metabolic rate. In simpler terms, this means producing energy with oxygen, or in the case of anaerobic exercise, producing energy without oxygen.</p>
