HYPERTROPHY VS STRENGTH TRAINING Clean Health Fitness Institute From cleanhealth.edu.au
Hypertrophy is a desired outcome in many sports. Although variation may be achieved in a number of different manners within the training process, at the training session level advanced approaches to stimulating adaptations can be employed. Frequency can refer to the number of resistance training sessions performed in a given period of time, as well as to the number of times a specific muscle group is trained over a given period. Loading recommendations for resistance training are typically prescribed along what has come to be known as the “repetition continuum”, which proposes that the number of repetitions performed at a given magnitude of load will result in specific adaptations.
