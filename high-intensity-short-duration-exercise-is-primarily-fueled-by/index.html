The decrease in extracellular calcium caused by sweating. During high intensity exercise the products of anaerobic glycolysis namely pyruvate and h&#43; accumulate rapidly. Background traditional high volume aerobic exercise training reduces cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk but involves a substantial time commitment. Short, high intensity exerciseshort, high intensity exercise can take many forms, but it has certain constants—the exercise will be purely anaerobic in its nature (usually activities or individual segments of a longer exercise of fewer than 90 seconds duration), and it will require the athlete to perform at between 75% and 85% of the maximum physical capability.

[low, high] exercise intensity and [short, long] exercise duration shift the body towards burning more free fatty acids (i.e., fats) primarily from adipose tissue. The lactate is then quickly removed from the muscle cell, protecting the cell from becoming too acidic so exercise can continue for a little longer. There is 4 to 5 times more pcr in skeletal muscle than atp and the immediate energy system begins to resynthesize atp anaerobically via pcr hydrolysis as soon as the working muscles contract.
