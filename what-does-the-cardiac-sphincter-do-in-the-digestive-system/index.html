<p>For example, the digestive system has several sphincters that regulate the passage of fluid and food from the mouth to the stomach, through the intestines, and out the anus. The opening and closing of the sphincter is controlled by peristaltic waves produced by the stomach during the digestion process. The sphincter of oddi (also hepatopancreatic sphincter or glissonâs sphincter), abbreviated as so, is a muscular valve that in some animals, including humans, controls the flow of digestive juices (bile and pancreatic juice) out of the pancreas through the ampulla of vater into the second part of the duodenum.
