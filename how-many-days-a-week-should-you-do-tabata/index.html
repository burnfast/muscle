The more oxygen you can use, the better your endurance will be. So in order to tax the body as much as you truly need to to get a legitimate tabata workout, you need adequate rest. The american heart association recommends 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity per week (that equates to 30 minutes a day for five days), or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week for good. Perform each exercise at maximum effort for 20 seconds, and then rest for 10 seconds.
