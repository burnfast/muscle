<p>Data are presented as meanÂ±standard deviation. 67,68 investigation into the effects of aerobic exercise on the motor system has recently been initiated to expand upon the current understanding of the impact of exercise on cognitive function and overall brain health. However, previous research investigating the use of resistance exercise to increase bdnf levels has been less conclusive, likely due to the low intensity nature of traditional resistance exercise programs. High intensity interval training and continuous aerobic exercises improve the brain's ability to form new connections. Fabio LIRA Professor (Assistant) Ph.D SÃ£o Paulo State University.</p>
