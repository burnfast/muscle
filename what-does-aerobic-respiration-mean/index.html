<meta name="description" content="Popular What Does Aerobic Respiration Mean With Equipment, There are two types of respiration: Aerobic respiration — takes place in the presence of oxygen.
Respiration From slideshare.net
This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals. It’s a metabolic process that uses oxygen molecules to generate energy. Cell respiration usually occurs in the presence of oxygen (see aerobic respiration) but some organisms can respire without oxygen (see anaerobic respiration ). It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food.

<p>Aerobic respiration is important because it is the primary way that your cells produce energy. In this process, water and carbon dioxide are produced as end products. It is a process when glucose is broken down to carbon dioxide in the presence of oxygen to produce energy in the form of atp. Glucose is known as a respiratory substrate, and is broken down by cells to produce energy in the form of atp. PPT KS4 Biology PowerPoint Presentation, free download ID502951.</p>
