It’s especially key when you’ve been out of the gym for a long time, though, and are getting ready to lift weights again. To build strength, you’ll want to start with 1 to 2 sets of 12 to 15 reps of exercises such as squats, push ups, or lunges. Of course, with light weight. Well, after a long workout break, things may look little different for you.
