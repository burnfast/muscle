Light weights as good as heavy lifting for building muscle and strength From joe.co.uk
However, as with most things that look good in theory, in real life this phenomenon is not completely accurate. I want to give you a list of the ten things that you have to do to build muscle fast as a natural lifter. And while this is the basic answer, to get a more detailed explanation about what’s best for you.

<p>If you choose good exercises, train in the hypertrophy rep range, and you lift hard, 4 sets per muscle may very well be enough, and makes for a good place to start. When it comes to muscle mass, research suggests that after 40 years of age we lose about 5% of muscle mass per decade with even more accelerated losses after the age of 65 (candow et al 2011). The best way to build size and get bigger is by stimulating hypertrophy and muscle growth. To maximize our rate of muscle growth, we want.

<p>Lifting heavy causes more tears in muscle fibre, and that's what causes a build in muscle growth over time. When it comes to muscle mass, research suggests that after 40 years of age we lose about 5% of muscle mass per decade with even more accelerated losses after the age of 65 (candow et al 2011). Size, on the other hand, is about getting a pump and creating microscopic damage to the muscle, which then causes it to repair and grow larger. William kraemer, the duke kahanamoku of modern weightlifting theory, stressed in his landmark 2004 paper that using high loads was absolutely necessary so that we could recruit the max number of muscle motor units and thus fully realize a muscle's growth potential.

<p>If you choose good exercises, train in the hypertrophy rep range, and you lift hard, 4 sets per muscle may very well be enough, and makes for a good place to start. Size, on the other hand, is about getting a pump and creating microscopic damage to the muscle, which then causes it to repair and grow larger. This notion of “lift heavy to grow big” also supports that the greater the resistance/stimulus applied to a muscle, the more muscle fibers get destroyed, thereby the more muscle growth is achieved.
