When you exercise, your brain realizes that your body needs more oxygen, so it speeds up the circulation of blood. Like the muscles of the body, the heart is a muscle, and regular exercise helps keep it toned and strong. People with diabetes are two to four times more likely to have a heart attack or stroke than those without diabetes, and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disability among people with diabetes.
