EBSCO Archives PT &amp; ME From ptandme.com
Persistent af is present in at least 20 % of patients with chronic heart failure (chf) and is related to a poor prognosis and more severe cardiac arrhythmias. There are 3 basic types of exercise — flexibility, cardiovascular/aerobic and strength training. Seventeen patients (ejection fraction 25 ± 2%) undertook brachial artery and right heart catheterization and oxygen consumption assessment. This is the first randomized study.

Regular aerobic exercise training is associated with pulmonary, cardiovascular, immune, autonomic and skeletal muscle metabolic adaptations that increase oxygen delivery and optimize energy utilization, as demonstrated in several small observational studies in patients with systolic chronic heart failure. Aerobic exercise training is strongly recommended in patients with heart failure (hf) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) to improve symptoms and quality of life.
