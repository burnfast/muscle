Your heart rate while running can be a good measurement of how hard youre working. When heart rate in adults exceeds 100 beats per minute at rest, then the condition is called tachycardia which has a pathological reason behind. This is also because during this time our muscles need more energy to respond to the various calls that we make on them to move our body with increased vigor (1, 2). This may further indicate heart disease.
