<p>As epidermal cells move up through the strata away from their blood supply, they die and become keratinized. Ultra violet light (the sun), pollution, smoking, harsh product use, improper product use, change of seasons, climate, travel and exercise all impact the ability of the skin to function at its best. Environmental factors also affect skin thickness. Skin color explains 10.4% of variation in skin pattern at age 12, which is due to additive genetic influences common to both.
