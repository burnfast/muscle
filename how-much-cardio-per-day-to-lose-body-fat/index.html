How Much Cardio To Lose Weight From howmuchcardiotoloseweight202120.blogspot.com
The national institutes of health notes that women can usually lose weight safely on a diet of 1,200 to 1,500 calories per day, and men on a diet of 1,500 to 1,800 calories per day. Although nutrition plays more of a role in losing weight (not eating more calories than you burn), doing cardio will help you lose overall body. More cardio is not necessarily better. Losing total body fat, which will make your belly shrink proportionately, begins with creating a calorie deficit.
