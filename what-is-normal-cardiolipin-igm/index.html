<p>The anti cardiolipin igm antibody test enables you to diagnose inappropriate blood clot, analyze the cause for regular miscarriages, and analyze any autoimmune diseases. However, if these tests are negative and clinical suspicions still exist, then iga cardiolipin antibody testing may be ordered. There are three classes of cardiolipin antibodies, namely igg, igm and/or iga, which are present in the blood. Lupus anticoagulant present in plasma, on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart 2. Schematic drawing depicting the intracellular traffic of cardiolipin.</p>

<p>Tests for igg and igm cardiolipin antibodies are frequently requested to help find the cause of an unexplained thrombotic episode, recurrent miscarriage, or thrombocytopenia.they may be requested with lupus anticoagulant testing to help investigate the cause of a prolonged ptt (activated partial thromboplastin time), especially if clinical findings. A negative result means only that the cardiolipin antibody class tested (igg, igm, and/or iga) is not present at this time. Persistence is defined as moderate or high levels of igg and/or igm cl antibodies detected in two or more.
