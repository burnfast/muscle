<p>Since oxygen is transported through the bloodstream, the heart needs to pump more blood to supply the working muscles with oxygen. This system comprises the heart, blood vessels, and blood, and is responsible for moving blood throughout the body.

<p>When exercising your heart rate increases and the “left heart” have to pump out more oxygenated blood to the entire body. The most popular hypothesis used to explain the initiation of cardiovascular responses to exercise is the ‘feedforward’ or ‘central command’ theory. The circulatory system plays a critical role in maintaining homeostasis during exercise. To accommodate the increased metabolic activity in skeletal muscle, the circulatory system must properly control the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide, as well as help to buffer the ph level of active tissues. exercise physiology Google Search Physical Training Pinterest.</p>
