<p>Igm is produced by the body in response to a foreign invader, such as a virus or bacteria, while igg is produced by the body in response to a different type of antigen. The antibody igm is found to be in lymph and blood, while igg is found to be in body fluids. Although the iga isotype of acl is tested together with igg and igm isotype, it is not included in the diagnostic criteria of aps since the prevalence of iga among patients with aps patients is significantly lower than that of igg/igm.
