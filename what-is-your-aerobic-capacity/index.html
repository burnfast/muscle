You can boost v02 max through training, but there are still limitations based on genetics, sex, age, and body composition. This measurement is an indication of (1) the ability of the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen to working muscles and (2) the ability of those muscles to extract oxygen for energy generation in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp). Your individual aerobic fitness level determines your heart rate on the at so there isn’t one specific optimal threshold. For example, the at of people with poor aerobic fitness may be at 60% of their hr max, whereas the at of trained athletes may be at 85% of their hr max.
