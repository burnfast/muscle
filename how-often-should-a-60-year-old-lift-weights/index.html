Weight training in older adults will also increase power output, makes performing tasks and moving around easier, improves body composition (reduces fat/increases muscle mass), improves insulin sensitivity, improves fat metabolism (reduces blood cholesterol), and improves balance. You need to lift a weight heavy enough to damage muscle fibers to make a muscle bigger and stronger, but causing more damage than that. Weight training makes all sorts of everyday jobs easier.
