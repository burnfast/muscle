<p>Boyd discusses the feed conversion ratio and the benefits of reducing it, which include less feed waste, improved water quality, improved fifo and reduced oxygen demand. Feed conversion ratio (fcr) is defined as the weight of the input divided by the output (thus weight of feed per weight of shrimp). The feed conversion ratio varied from 1.1:1 to 1.2:1 and the shrimp yields were in the range of 10 to 20 tonnes/ha/crop. Fcr is a measure of shrimp’s efficiency in converting feed mass into increased body mass. A Low Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) is the Indicator of Efficient.</p>
