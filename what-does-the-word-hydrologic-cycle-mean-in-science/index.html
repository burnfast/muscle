The water cycle From slideshare.net
Evaporation is the primary pathway that water moves from the liquid state back into the water cycle as atmospheric water vapour. It is important because it is how water reaches plants, animals, and human beings. In the hydrologic cycle, atmospheric water reaches the earth&#39;s surface as precipitation. The major processes are condensation by which precipitation is formed, movement and storage of water overland or underground, evaporation, and the horizontal transport of moisture.
