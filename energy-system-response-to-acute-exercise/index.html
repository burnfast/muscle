Response to Acute Exercise by Richie Croydon From haikudeck.com
Energy production must increase to meet demand. As a result the predominant energy system and fuel source used changes throughout the exercise in order to maintain the required level of performance. Which energy system provides our immediate energy? The energy systems of the body work aerobically (with oxygen) or anaerobically (without oxygen).

<p>Our bodies respond immediately to just one exercise session, but we see large adaptations to our bodies when we train consistently over time. At the onset of exercise the demand for o 2 and energy sources by the working muscles increases and the cardiovascular, respiratory and muscular systems respond to meet these demands. The body moves through different muscle contractions. The blood supply has to increase because it has to go to the parts in your body which you are exercising the most e.</p>

<p>An energy systems response to acute exercise happens when the exercise is of a high intensity, which is too much for the cardiovascular and respiratory system to deal with. Studies in humans and animals have shown that brain blood flow remains largely unchanged in response to acute exercise (8, 65, 91). A complex chemical compound formed with the energy released from food and stored in all cells, particularly muscles. As a result of exercise, atp stores decrease in the muscle, and stores of adp, the by product of atp increase when exercise intensity increases, there is an increase in the rate of metabolism required to produce atp in the muscles heat is a by product of the process of converting chemical energy (fuel) into mechanical energy (movement).
