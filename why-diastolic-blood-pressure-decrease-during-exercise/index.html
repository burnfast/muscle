Why Does Diastolic Blood Pressure Stay the Same During Exercise From livestrong.com
The slight decrease in diastolic blood pressure is due primarily to the vasodilation of the arteries from the exercise bout. The peripheral vasculature dilates with exercise this facilitates runoff from the arterial system during both phases and decreases the pressure in diastole created for people with ongoing healthcare needs but benefits everyone. The slight decrease in diastolic blood pressure is due primarily to the vasodilation of the arteries from the exercise bout. However, our results show a thoroughly different response to static exercise, at least when compared with dynamic exercises at either the same relative intensity or the same mean blood pressure, suggesting a different balance of the modulation factors for heart rate and blood pressure.

<p>Thus, now we have cleared out why blood pressure rises during. As you exercise, your blood flow to your muscles must increase. During upright exercise, the normal blood pressure response is to observe a progressive increase in systolic blood pressure with no change or even a slight decrease in diastolic blood pressure. The heart rate usually returns to normal within 2 minutes of stopping the exercise.</p>

<p>A reading of less than 80 is normal for diastolic blood pressure. A drop in diastolic pressure after exercise that has been talked above is also normal, but it should come to the normal level later. When youâre exercising, your muscles have an increased need for oxygen, which is why your blood pressure increases during exercise.
