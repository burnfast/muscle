The ventilatory response to exercise was defined as the value of v̇ e /v̇ co 2 at peak exercise. Average maximum heart rate, 100%. 9 benefits of anaerobic exercise. This has important implications for trials that employ hr to monitor exercise intensity, as reducing work rate in order to keep hr constant could result in participants.

<p>The ventilatory response to exercise was defined as the value of v̇ e /v̇ co 2 at peak exercise. This results in a marked increase and redistribution of the cardiac output. In order to change cardiac output, there may be a change in either heart rate or stroke volume. Heart rate responds to training by increasing from the resting value and is often used to set or determine the intensity of the training session.</p>
