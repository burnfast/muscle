“acute cardiopulmonary process” is a general term for any one of several diagnoses involving a sudden effect on heart or lung function—a myocardial infarction (heart attack) or pulmonary embolism (blood clot traveling to the lung), for example. They also help transport carbon dioxide, which is a cellular waste, out of the body. The term cardiopulmonary disease describes a range of conditions that affect the heart and lungs. The american heart association recommends starting cpr with hard and fast chest compressions.
