<p>Four main sphincter muscles along the alimentary canal aid in digestion: [ sfingk´ter ] a circular muscle that constricts a passage or closes a natural orifice. For example, the digestive system has several sphincters that regulate the passage of fluid and food from the mouth to the stomach, through the intestines, and out the anus. A sphincterotomy is used as a last resort for this condition, and people who experience anal fissures are usually encouraged to try. Sphincter Augmentation with a Large Hiatal Hernia YouTube.</p>
