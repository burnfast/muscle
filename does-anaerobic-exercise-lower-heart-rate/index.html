Specifically the left ventricle and it might also stiffen the aorta (the artery that immediately attaches to the heart) as well. To achieve a lower resting heart rate from exercise, you should exercise at least 150 minutes a week in your aerobic zone. Aerobic exercise improves circulation, which results in lowered blood pressure and heart rate, stewart says. Rhr is lowered as the heart muscle becomes stronger and gets better at.

<p>To achieve a lower resting heart rate from exercise, you should exercise at least 150 minutes a week in your aerobic zone. In anaerobic exercise, such as weightlifting and sprinting, your bodyâs need for oxygen exceeds the oxygen that is available. Although aerobic exercise works the heart and lungs more than anaerobic exercise, one fitness program can. Also, first improve your cardio via some basic aerobic training, before stepping up the intensity with fast paced cardio exercises.</p>

<p>Anaerobic exercise relies mostly on stored glycogen for energy production, and it builds muscular strength. If your exercise intensity fluctuated during your session, your heart rate will also fluctuate. To find the target heart rate range for your age, subtract your age from 220 and then multiply that number by 0.60 and by 0.80 to find the low and high ends of the range.
