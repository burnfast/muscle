<p>By strict definition, vo2 max (maximal oxygen uptake) is the greatest amount of oxygen that can be used at the cellular level for the entire body. It is especially important for the middle distances (800 to 3,000 meters), events that are run at or close to 100 percent vo2 max. Vo2max = 61ml/kg/min and trains at 80% of max: This study aims to determine the effect of endurance training on the vo2max. Graphs show the mean pulmonary responses (n = 12) in highintensity.</p>
