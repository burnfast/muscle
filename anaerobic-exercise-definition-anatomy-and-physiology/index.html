Certain circumstances require the body to produce energy faster than oxygen delivery can take place. During exercise with adequate fuel and oxygen (i.e., aerobic), muscle cells can contract repeatedly…. 3) all hydrogen atoms in the glucose are not replaced.

<p>Each energy system is used in differing amounts. Despite the high quality of most of the investigations, the terms aerobic/anaerobic continue to be used inappropriately by some researchers in exercise. At rest, our nervous system maintains a parasympathetic tone, which affects the respiratory rate, cardiac output, and various metabolic processes. Anaerobic literally means “without air,” so anaerobic exercise is an intense exercise that requires the body to use other sources of energy besides oxygen to fuel the muscles.</p>

<p>Most of our cells prefer to get their energy by using oxygen to fuel metabolism. Anaerobic bacteria are germs that can survive and grow where there is no oxygen.
