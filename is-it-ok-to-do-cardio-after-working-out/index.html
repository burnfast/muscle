<p>Cardio can increase blood flow to muscles helping bring more nutrients. There is nothing wrong with doing some cardio (20 to 30 minutes maximum) after your weight training, but it should not be excessive or you will severely hamper the physiological and hormonal mechanisms that lead to muscular hypertrophy. If you do cardio before working out with weights, your energy levels will be very low. Whether you want to gain muscle and power, improve your body composition, or just feel stronger in your daily activities, you should hit the weight room before the treadmill if you plan on doing both cardio and strength training in a single session.</p>
