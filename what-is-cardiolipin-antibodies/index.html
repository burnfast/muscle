ANTI CARDIOLIPIN ANTIBODY From slideshare.net
Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting. This test helps your healthcare provider diagnose clotting disorders and autoimmune diseases. An iga phospholipid (cardiolipin) antibody result above 15 apl with negative igg and igm phospholipids (cardiolipin) antibody results is not diagnostic for aps. It measures the concentration of antibodies related to a fat molecule in your blood.
