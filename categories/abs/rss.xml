&lt;p&gt;In general, expect your strength workouts to span 20 to 90 minutes. Many bodybuilders like to do their cardio early in the morning before work or school and then go back later in the day for their weight training. More experienced lifters can still benefit from a basic strength program but should aim for three to four sessions each week, lasting about 30. To provide even greater health benefit and to assist with weight loss or maintaining weight loss, at least 300 minutes a week is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
