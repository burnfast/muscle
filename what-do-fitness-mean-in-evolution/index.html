In evolution, fitness is about success at surviving and reproducing, not about exercise and strength. Fitness is not the fastest or lifts the most weight. What is meant by fitness in evolutionary terms? Evolution shows that, as much as possible, organisms will evolve to optimize their fitness — the number of descendents they produce for future generations relative to other organisms.
