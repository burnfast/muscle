<p>Duration of cardiac cycle depends on the heart rate per minute. The contraction of the heart is known as systole and relaxation is termed as diastole. Each cardiac cycle begins with the generation of an electrical stimulus in the sinus node and the consequent contraction of the atria and ends with the relaxation of the ventricles. Cardiac cycle is the process in which the blood gets pumped by the heart and gets delivered to the body organs and tissues by the blood vessels and returns back to the heart.

<p>One heartbeat is a single cycle in which your heart contracts and relaxes to pump blood. Pressure from the atria then forces the atrioventricular valves open and blood flows into the ventricles. This is created by the relationship between three things: These pressure changes result in the movement of blood through different chambers of the heart and the body as a whole.

<p>The cardiac cycle refers to the pattern of contraction and relaxation of the heart during one complete heartbeat. Myocardiocytes are unique cells found in the heart that are able to independently. Hence when the heart rate is increased to 120 beats per minute, the cardiac cycle duration will be about. The cardiac cycle is the performance of the human heart from the beginning of one heartbeat to the beginning of the next. Cardiac cycle Nurse, Cardiac nursing, Medical.</p>

<p>These pressure changes result in the movement of blood through different chambers of the heart and the body as a whole. During the ventricular diastole period, the atria and heart ventricles are relaxed and the atrioventricular valves. The contraction of the heart is known as systole and relaxation is termed as diastole.

<p>The cardiac cycle may be divided into phases in any number of methods, for instance four phases [1,3] or seven phases [2].in the four phases method, the opening and closing of the heart valves explains this method of the cardiac cycle. During the ventricular diastole period, the atria and heart ventricles are relaxed and the atrioventricular valves. It consists of two periods: One during which the heart muscle relaxes and refills with blood, called diastole, following a period of robust contraction and pumping of blood, called systole.after emptying, the heart immediately relaxes and expands to receive.

<p>Pressure from the atria then forces the atrioventricular valves open and blood flows into the ventricles. Cardiac cycle is the process in which the blood gets pumped by the heart and gets delivered to the body organs and tissues by the blood vessels and returns back to the heart. Atrial diastole atrial systole isovolumic contraction ventricular ejection isovolumic relaxation ventricular filling Systole and diastole affect each other in an intimate manner to accomplish this goal.
